# GTK Theme
You'll need to go to [this website](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1357889/) and install the orchis red file. After installing, unzip and put the resulting folder in ~/.themes. Install nwg-look and apply theme from the widgets tab.

You'll want a icon theme to go with this theme as well. You can find them [here](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1279924/). Install Tela-red icons. After installing unzip and put resulting folder in ~/.icons. You'll be able to apply this with nwg-look as well- under the icon theme tab. If you want to use a custom xcursor, you'll need to put that folder in ~/.icons as well. You can apply cursor themes from nwg-look and from your WM/DE's settings.

As for the QT themes, I cba doing it :/ There wasn't a good red Kvantum theme anywhere so if you can do it, maybe you can tell me too.
